{"strIdent": "2011.01280", "strTitle": "Revisiting Adaptive Convolutions for Video Frame Interpolation", "strAuthors": "Simon Niklaus, Long Mai, Oliver Wang", "strSummary": "Video frame interpolation, the synthesis of novel views in time, is an increasingly popular research direction with many new papers further advancing the state of the art. But as each new method comes with a host of variables that affect the interpolation quality, it can be hard to tell what is actually important for this task. In this work, we show, somewhat surprisingly, that it is possible to achieve near state-of-the-art results with an older, simpler approach, namely adaptive separable convolutions, by a subtle set of low level improvements. In doing so, we propose a number of intuitive but effective techniques to improve the frame interpolation quality, which also have the potential to other related applications of adaptive convolutions such as burst image denoising, joint image filtering, or video prediction.", "strPdf": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01280v1"}
